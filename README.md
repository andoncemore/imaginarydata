# Imaginary Data Collection

This is a small frontend app that uses the google static streetview api and the google maps javascript API to let users label and create imaginary data for a speculative object detection algorithm. 

The flask backend lets the frontend app send data to the server for storage, and can be used to print the collected images into large reciept-printed panoramas (if a ESC-POS reciept printer is connected over USB)
